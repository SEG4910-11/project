QuickForms Application Manager
=======
This is the source code of the client and our code is added to it. Basically, the main file that our code is design.js which is found in the quickforms/dom/js folder.

The quickform folder is the server where all the three applications Palis3, segCourse, and RPP are implemented using it. Therefore, since our code should work on all Quickform 3.0 version, design.js should be in there applicable to all these applications.

Another folder which is called "test" contains our basic test cases that are being implemented to test our code.
