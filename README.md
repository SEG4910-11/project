QuickForms Application Manager
=======
This is the source code of the client and our code is added to it. The main file that our code is design.js which is found in the quickforms/js/dom/form folder.

The quickform folder contains the server which all three applications Quickforms applications (Palis3, segCourse, RPP) are implemented with. Since our code should work on all applications which implement Quickforms version 3.0, design.js should be included in all of these applications in order for the design capabilities to be applied. 

Another folder which is called "test" contains our basic test cases that are being implemented to test our code.
